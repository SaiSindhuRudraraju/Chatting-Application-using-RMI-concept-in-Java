# Chat Application Using Java RMI

This is a simple console-based chat application built using **Java RMI (Remote Method Invocation)**.  
It allows multiple clients to connect to a central server and send messages to other connected clients.

## üìå What is RMI?

**Java RMI** allows one Java program to invoke methods of an object running on another **JVM** (possibly on another machine). This helps in building **distributed applications**.

In Java RMI system allows an object running in one Java Virtual Machine to invoke method or an object running in another JVM. RMI provides for remote communication between programs written in the Jva programming language.
RMI applications often compare two seperate programs. A server and a Client. A typical server program creates some remote objects, make references to these objects accessible and waits for clients to invoke methods on these objects. A typical client program obtains a remote reference to one or more remote objetcs on a server and then invoke methods on them. RMI provides he mechanisms by which the server and the client communicate and pass information back and forth. Such an application is sometimes reffered to as **distributed object application**. They do as follows:
  1) Locate remote objects
  2) Communicate with remote objects
  3) Load class definitions for objects that are passed around
### How RMI Works:
1. A **Remote Interface** defines the methods that can be called remotely.
2. A **Server** creates and registers an implementation of that interface in the **RMI Registry**.
3. A **Client** looks up the remote object from the registry and invokes its methods as if it were local.

## üèóÔ∏è Project Overview

### Remote Interfaces
| Interface | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `IChat` | Allows clients to connect and send messages. |
| `IChatClient` | Allows server to deliver messages and notify when a new client joins. |

### Main Classes
| Class | Role |
|------|------|
| `Chat` | Server-side implementation of `IChat`, stores client references and sends messages. |
| `chatClient` | Client-side implementation of `IChatClient`, displays received messages. |
| `Server` | Launches the RMI server and registers the `Chat` object. |
| `Client` | Connects to server, sends and receives chat messages. |

### 1 Start RMI Registry
Open a terminal in your project folder and run:
rmiregistry 4050
### 2 Compile All files
javac *.java
### 3 Start the Server
java Server
### 4 Start multiple clients and assign name
java Client

### 5 try sending messages like:
client name:message
Example: client1:Hello
